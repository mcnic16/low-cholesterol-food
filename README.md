"Low Chloestrol Recipes" -  Data-Centric  Milestone Project.


The purpose of this full-stack MongoDB-based Flask project is to create a database of recipes that allows users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) low cholesterol recipes. This gives access to all the recipes in the database for registered users. Registered users can add new recipes, edit and delete their own ones, as well as edit their username and password or delete there account.


# UX


My main goal in UX was to build a simple to use website where users can create their own recipes, view all the recipes, edit and delete their recipes. The target audience for this app is anyone who is looking for low cholesterol food.
This website has a user-friendly interface with easy access to all information. This app has been developed so registered users can easily add, delete and edit there own recipes with there own personal database.
